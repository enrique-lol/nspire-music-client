## Read Me! (intro)
nSpire Music's goal is to be the social-network where music listeners can go to review and
discover new music. Users can pick any music project and reflect their opinion on it.

This repository is only the front-end of the whole project. The back-end server code
can be found here:

## Development Timeline
### Account Functionality
Some default account settings are: signing up, in, out, and changing passwords.

### Post Functionality
Then, the next step was adding user-content features: posts. A user can create, edit the contents, or delete an entire post/review.

## Problem-Solving Strategies
I've found some trouble-shooting or problem-solving Strategies along the way: At the beginning of every function, I would console.log() in order to see if I truly made it to that function. After every API request, I would console.log() it to see what type it is and how to access data inside it.

## Unsolved issues
On the Settings and New Post page, all the contents are on the left-hand side and it does not look very pleasing.
